# Star Wars Survey Project

*Disclaimer: This project is based on the data cleaning walkthrough provided by dataquest.io. Though my own take on this project might differ from what can be found on their website.*

## The Project
In this project I will try to showcase my skills in data cleaning. While I will perform some explorations and analytic work on the data, they will remain at a lower level of complexity. For higher complexity work in data visualization and exploration as well as analytics I would refer readers to my dedicated projects in these topics.

## The Question
In this project I will clean up a dataset by fivethirtyeight. The team collected data based on a survey on the Star Wars movies by 835 people. 

## The Data
The data comes from the fivethirtyeight's [github-repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

## Skills Used:
* cleaning up data columns using type conversion, boolean masks and vectorized functions
* renaming and formatting columns
* basic data visualization using matplotlib
